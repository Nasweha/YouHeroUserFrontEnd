# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




yourHero
-----------
yourHero is a Superhero Grievance Website where users can log their grievances, and superheroes can manage and resolve these issues. The platform is visually engaging, with storytelling elements, responsive design, and a dynamic user interface. The project is divided into two separate web applications:

1) User Application: Allows users to log grievances.
2) Superhero Dashboard: Enables superheroes to manage and resolve grievances.

----------------------
React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
react-router-dom: For handling page navigation.
react-toastify: For displaying notifications (toasts) when grievances are logged or resolved.
axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.

Backend (Node.js/Express):
---------------------------
Express.js: Node.js framework for building the RESTful API.
Mongoose: For interacting with MongoDB, storing user grievances and superhero actions.
nodemailer: For sending email notifications to users.

Development Tools:
--------------------
